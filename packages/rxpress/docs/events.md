# Events

The event bus is the heart of `rxpress`. Every request context (routes, cron jobs, reactive watchers, gRPC handlers) includes an `emit` helper so that handlers can broadcast data decoupled from the original HTTP response.

## Emitting & Subscribing

```ts
const routes: RPCConfig[] = [
  {
    type: 'api',
    method: 'POST',
    path: '/orders',
    handler: async (req, { emit, kv }) => {
      const order = await saveOrder(req.body);
      kv.set(`order:${order.id}`, order);
      emit({ topic: 'orders::created', data: order });
      return { status: 201, body: order };
    },
  },
];

const events: EventConfig[] = [
  {
    subscribe: ['orders::created'],
    handler: async (order, { logger }) => {
      logger.info('Order created', order as Record<string, unknown>);
    },
  },
  {
    subscribe: ['orders::created'],
    handler: async (order, { emit }) => {
      emit({ topic: 'billing::invoice', data: order });
    },
  },
];
```

If you need runtime validation of the payload, supply a Zod schema and the handler receives the parsed object. Additionally, if you set `strict: true` an error is logged and the event is skipped should validation fail:

```ts
import * as z from 'zod';

const orderSchema = z.object({ id: z.string(), total: z.number() });

const events: EventConfig<z.infer<typeof orderSchema>>[] = [
  {
    subscribe: ['orders::created'],
    strict: true,
    schema: orderSchema,
    handler: async (order, { logger }) => {
      logger.info('Validated order created', order);
    },
  },
];
```

Event handlers receive:

- `trigger`: topic name which initiated this event
- `logger`
- `kv` / `kvPath`: persistent storage adapters (direct key lookup + dot-path helpers)
- `run`: run-scoped store that is cleared automatically when flow completes
- `emit`: emit additional events

Because handlers run on RxJS observables you can fan-out, buffer, or throttle streams with custom operators if desired.

## gRPC-powered events

To execute an event handler in another process (or another language) switch the config to `kind: 'grpc'`. The bridge forwards the payload, run ID, and span context so remote handlers can continue emitting events, logging, and interacting with the same KV/store.

```ts
const auditEvent: EventConfig = {
  kind: 'grpc',
  subscribe: ['orders::created'],
  emits: ['audit::recorded'],
  grpc: {
    handlerName: 'orders-handler',
    timeoutMs: 2_000,
  },
};

rxpress.addEvents(auditEvent);
```

The remote handler receives `method === 'event'` and can branch accordingly:

```ts
export const handler = {
  name: 'orders-handler',
  async invoke(method, input, meta, ctx) {
    if (method === 'event') {
      ctx.log('info', 'recording audit log', { trigger: input.topic });
      await ctx.emit({ topic: 'audit::recorded', data: input.payload, run: ctx.run });
      return {};
    }
    // handle HTTP/RPC invocations in the same module if desired
  },
};
```

Refer to [`docs/grpc.md`](./grpc.md) for provisioning tips and language-specific considerations.

## Best Practices

- **Keep handlers idempotent.** They may be triggered from cron jobs or retries.
- **Emit domain events, not implementation details.** For example `orders::created` rather than `sql::inserted`.
- **Leverage adapters.** Use the provided `logger` and `kv` instances so that tests can inject in-memory substitutes.
- **Register emitters.** Populate the `emits` array on routes, cron jobs, and reactive watchers so `rxpress` can validate that every topic has a matching subscriber. Reactive watchers can emit directlyâ€”declaring `emits` keeps the topology and validation accurate.
- **Enable strict validation for shared contracts.** Provide a Zod schema + `strict: true` to reject malformed payloads early; optional schemas without `strict` still attempt parsing but fall back to the original data on failure.

See [`packages/rxpress/__tests__/rxpress.integration.test.ts`](../__tests__/rxpress.integration.test.ts) for an end-to-end example that asserts emitted events.
